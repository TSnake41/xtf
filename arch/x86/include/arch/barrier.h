/*
 * Memory barriers for x86 systems
 *
 * See Linux: Documentation/memory-barriers.txt for a very detailed
 * description of the problems and their implications.
 *
 * Under Xen, we rely on the fact that only x86_64 cpus are supported, which
 * guarantees that the {m,l,s}fence instructions are supported (SSE2 being a
 * requirement of 64bit).
 *
 * x86 memory ordering requirements make the smp_???() variants easy.  From
 * the point of view of program order, reads may not be reordered with respect
 * to other reads, and writes may not be reordered with respect to other
 * writes, causing smp_rmb() and smp_wmb() to degrade to simple compiler
 * barriers.
 *
 * smp_mb() however does need to provide real ordering, as reads are permitted
 * to be reordered ahead of non-aliasing writes.
