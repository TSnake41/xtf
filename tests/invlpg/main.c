 * @page test-invlpg Invlpg Handling
 *
 * The `invlpg` instruction was introduced in the 486 processor.  Its purpose
 * is to invalidate a specific TLB entry without being a general TLB flush.
 * It takes a single memory operand, but doesn't behave like other
 * instructions referencing memory.
 *
 * It is not documented to suffer the usual memory-based faults (@#GP/@#SS)
 * for a bad segment, or segment limit violation.  It is documented to be a
 * NOP when given a non-canonical address, as opposed to raising a fault.
 *
 * Experimentally, it does take into account segment bases when calculating
 * which mapping to invalidate, but will also invalidate mappings beyond the
 * segment limit.
 *
 * This test is divided into two parts.
 *
 *
 * ### 1) TLB Refill test ###
 *
 * This code was originally built to confirm whether segment bases were taken
 * into account by the `invlpg` instruction.  It is kept because it is useful
 * to compare the behaviour of the HAP and shadow paging modes, as well as the
 * emulated invlpg path in each mode.
 *
 * The algorithm relies on the fact that a hardware pagetable walk which loads
 * a mapping into the TLB for writing will perform an atomic set of the
 * Accessed and Dirty bits in the pagetable entry.  Subsequent writes via a
 * mapping present in the TLB do not alter the pagetable entries.
 *
 * Two mappings are chosen (in this example, the mapping for 4k and 8k
 * physical addresses, but any two will do).  Writes are performed to force a
 * TLB fill, then the A/D bits are cleared in the PTEs.  An `invlpg`
 * instruction is issued to invalidate one of mappings, and further writes are
 * performed.
 *
 * By inspecting the A/D bits in the PTEs after the second write, it can be
 * determined which mappings where invalidated.  A mapping which wasn't
 * invalidated will not require a refill, so the A/D bits will be left clear.
 * A mapping which was invalidated will necessarily require a refill, which
 * will set the A/D bits.
 *
 * There is a race condition with vcpu scheduling; if a reschedule occurs
 * between the two sets of writes, the TLB might be flushed for reasons not
 * related to this test.  As a result, if both mappings are seen to refill,
 * the test is repeated (up to a maximum number of tries).
 *
 * The interaction of segment bases can be identified by issuing an `invlpg`
 * against the first mapping, with a segment base with would shift the linear
 * address to the second mapping, by observing which mapping was refilled into
 * the TLB.
 *
 *
 * ### 2) Faulting conditions ###
 *
 * This part of the test checks that the `invlpg` instruction doesn't fault
 * under conditions which a normal instruction with a memory operand would.
 *
 * - A virtual address with a valid mapping.
 * - A virtual address with an invalid mapping.
 * - A NULL segment override.
 * - Beyond the segment limit.
 * - Between the base and limit of an expand-down segment.
 *
 * Additionally, for 64bit environments:
 *
 * - A non-canonical virtual address.
 * - A virtual address which, when combined with a segment base, becomes
 *   non-canonical.
 *
 * This part of the test is applicable to non-paged environments.
 *
 * @todo Find a better way dealing with forced emulation.  Versions of Xen
 * older than 4.7 crash the domain if they find an invlpg instruction while in
 * hap mode, which is unhelpful when trying to test behaviour.
 *
