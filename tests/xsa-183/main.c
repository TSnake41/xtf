 *
 * Advisory: [XSA-183](http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-183.html)
 *
 * This vulnerability only affects hardware supporting SMAP (Intel
 * Broadwell/AMD Zen or later) on Xen 4.5 or later (due to the addition of
 * software support to enable and use SMAP).
 *
 * Supervisor Mode Access Prevention is a hardware feature whereby an
 * Operating System can opt-in to more strict pagetable requirements, designed
 * to make it more robust, by raising a pagefault rather than accidentally
 * following a pointer into userspace.  However, legitimate accesses into
 * userspace require whitelisting.
 *
 * In Xen, compat_create_bounce_frame() is the function with the purpose of
 * creating an exception/interrupt frame on a guest stack (matching what
 * hardware would normally do).
 *
 * 32bit PV guest kernels, running in ring1, normally run on supervisor
 * mappings.  However, the guest kernel is in control of its own stack
 * pointer, so nothing stops the kernel putting @%esp over a user mapping.
 *
 * Under those circumstances if compat_create_bounce_frame() is invoked, it
 * will (legitimately) try to create an exception frame on the kernel stack.
 * If SMAP is enabled and the accesses are not whitelisted, Xen takes a fatal
 * pagefault and crashes.
 *
 * If vulnerable, Xen will crash citing a fatal SMAP fault in
 * compat_create_bounce_frame().  If not vulnerable, the test will exit
 * cleanly.
 *
