 * Advisory: [XSA-182](http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-182.html)
 *
 * There is a trick with pagetables, known as recursive pagetables (also
 * linear or twisted pagetables), where a top level pagetable referrers back
 * to itself.  This creates an area of virtual address space which accesses
 * the currently-active pagetables rather than the RAM mapped by them.  This
 * method is used by certain kernels as part of its memory management
 * subsystem.
 *
 * Xen has to code to cope with x86 PV guests creating such pagetables, albeit
 * it with the usual safety proviso that a PV guest must never be able to
 * write to its own pagetables.
 *
 * While the logic to create recursive pagetables does check and reject
 * writeable mappings, some of the the fastpath logic permitted changing the
 * writeable bit in isolation, allowing a guest to obtain writeable access to
 * its own pagetables.
 *
